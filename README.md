# CS441-Program3

## Quick summary

For this assignment, I needed to modify a given Racket implementation of a numeric expression evaluator. The original code used a Maybe monad for handling potential errors, and I had to convert it to an Either (Result) pattern, add variable management with state, and implement a REPL interface. This required understanding functional programming concepts like monads, state management without mutation, and Racket's specific syntax and libraries.
